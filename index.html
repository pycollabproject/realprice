      <p>Welcome to the RealPrice project website! This is an open source project, coded completely by the reddit
          community. The aim of the project is to create a product that allows users to easily find information on real
          estate prices in a selected area.</p>
      <h2>Goals:</h2>
      <p>This project is split into three development subdomains; user interface and design work, crawler and web
          scraping, and back end logic and processing. Each of these areas of development has it's own specific goals,
          upon completion of which the project will be considered 'successful'. The exact goals at this time are:</p>
      <h3>UI:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Creation of a graphical interface, that allows the user to input requested location and property type.</li>
        <li>Generation of a unique tag for each visitor, so that the request can be sent to the correct user.</li>
        <li>Allow the user to view data in multiple forms, including graphical representations and a map with prices
            overlayed.</li>
        <li>Written in HTML, CSS and JS, dependent on collaborator skill.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Crawler:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The creation of a wrapper based around the API for Zillow.</li>
        <li>Obtain purchase and rental price for a variety of homes in the requested area.</li>
        <li>Use some form of database management to compile all of the data and send it to the backend for processing
            </li>
        <li>Attach the tag of the requester to each API request, to enable it to be delivered to the correct
            user at the end.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Backend/ logic:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Process the data infoming from the crawler into mean, median prices as well as the interquartile range
            and lat/long location.</li>
        <li>Retain the association to each user with each request that is computed.</li>
        <li>Output simple, easily usable attributes to the UI team. It is possible that this team will also
            have to contribute to the map/ geolocation feature.</li>
      </ul>
